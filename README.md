# Notebook for Clustering Heart Disease Patient Data

This is a project from DataCamp.



## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains various attributes of heart disease patients, such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. It also includes the presence or absence of heart disease. 

## Methodology
I used various clustering algorithms in R, such as K-means and hierarchical clustering, to group the patients based on their attributes. By doing so, we can identify patterns and similarities among the patients, which can help in understanding the underlying factors contributing to heart disease.

## Results
The results of the clustering analysis are visualized using plots and charts.
